I have finally begun exploring and studying the complex shapes i am trying to achieve. With the help of my friend Arman, we spent the night trying to create and equilateral triangle. With great frustration and plenty of laughes we managed it. The challenge here is getting the angled cuts 90 degree rotated to the square of the cross section so the triangle edge was a sharp corner.
